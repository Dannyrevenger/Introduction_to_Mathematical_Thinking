# Introduction to Mathematical Thinking
This is a public repository that aims to store homework and quizzes of the Introduction to Mathematical Thinking course by Prof. Keith from Stanford University, hoping to develop into an all-star repository of this course. Since “To a thousand readers, there are a thousand Hamlets”, I just uploaded my perspective and understanding of some of the homework questions, and I sincerely hope New Bloods and experts can revise my error understanding and even better add some new supplementary perspectives which are of great honor.
